Demand analysis is an important part of transportation systems management. The aim of this project is to illustrate the demand modeling process for the commute trips in New York City. Data from the household travel survey called the Citywide Mobility Survey (CMS) will be used to assess New York City residents' travel behavior, preferences, and attitudes. 

Project should be performed individually; final report should be submitted as a pdf file of fully executed Jupyter Notebook following provided template. In addition, each student should present assigned section in class in accordance with presentation schedule. Presentations will be hold in the end of the class, every student will have 5 minutes to present. Jupyter Notebook with prepared presentation should be submitted to the UB BrightSpace the day before the presentation. 


# Project Description 

The aim of this project is to develop a model to estimate future transportation demand of commute trips at New York City, understand the usage of transit and bicycle travel modes, and explore transportation equity at New York City. Each student will develop a model that predicts future travel demand for commute trips on working days. This process will include the following steps: explore the data, predict future trips produced and attracted by each zone, conduct trip distribution for predicted trips, develop a discrete choice model using the survey data and the Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries for at least three zones, and discuss results.
